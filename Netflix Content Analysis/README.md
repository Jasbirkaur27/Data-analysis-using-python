# Netflix Content Analysis 2023

This project involves analyzing Netflix content data for the year 2023, with a focus on viewership trends, content types, and release months. The analysis is performed using **Python** and data visualization is primarily achieved with the **Plotly go library**. <br>

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into Netflix's content consumption patterns throughout 2023. We aim to answer questions such as:

- How do viewership hours vary by content type (movies vs shows)?
- Which months and seasons saw the highest engagement?
## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.
- **Visualization**: Generating interactive visualizations using Plotly's `go` library (Pie charts, Bar charts, and Line graphs).
- **Insights**: Summarizing key insights based on viewership hours, content types, and release months.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing and handling datasets.
- **Plotly (go)**: For creating interactive and visually appealing charts.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory analysis and documentation.
