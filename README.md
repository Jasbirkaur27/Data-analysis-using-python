# Data Analysis Projects 
Welcome to my Data Analysis repository! This repository contains a diverse collection of data analysis projects that showcase my skills in data cleaning, visualization. Each project has been completed using Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Pyplot**, and other tools for effective data exploration and visualization.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types to prepare datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights through statistical analysis and visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful plots and charts to represent findings clearly using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pyplot**.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Incorporating advanced Python libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary language used for all the projects.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: All projects are completed in Jupyter notebooks for an interactive analysis experience.
- **Libraries**: 
  - **NumPy** for efficient array operations.
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
  - **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Pyplot** for data visualization.
  - **Other tools**: CSV handling, and API data scraping (when applicable),importing images.

In addition to the data analysis projects, this repository also contains valuable notes and resources on key topics I encountered during my learning journey. These files cover important concepts, challenges I faced, and solutions I found by reading official documentation and exploring various online resources. They serve as a reference for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of data analysis techniques and troubleshoot common issues in the field.<br><br>
Thank you for checking out my Data Analysis repository. I hope you find the projects and analysis insightful and inspiring for your own learning or research.
