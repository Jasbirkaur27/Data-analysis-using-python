# Machine Learning
### Introduction 
Machine Learning means using data and algorithms to build intelligent systems. Machine Learning algorithms are computational procedures that enable machines to learn patterns and relationships from data without being explicitly programmed. These algorithms allow machines to make predictions, decisions, and classifications based on the patterns they have learned from the data. <br>
Various Types of Machine Learning Algorithms:<br>
1.Regression Algorithms<br>
2.linear Classification Algorithms<br>
3.Naive Bayes Algorithms<br>
4.SVM And KNN Algorithms<br>
5.Decision Tree<br>
6.CLusturing Algorithms <br>
