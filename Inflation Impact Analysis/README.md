# Inflation Impact Analysis
### Overview 
**Impact of Inflation: Case Study**<br>
The datasets comprises historical data on the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (INR) and the US Dollar (USD) from 1980 to 2024, along with corresponding inflation rates for India and the United States. The exchange rate data includes the average annual INR/USD exchange rate, while the inflation data captures the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for both countries. The dataset is structured with columns for the year, exchange rate, and inflation rates for each country, which enables a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between inflation and exchange rates over time.<br>
<br>
Inflation occurs when there is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. It impacts various aspects of the economy, including purchasing power, consumer behaviour, savings, and investment. Moderate inflation is typically a sign of a healthy, growing economy, as it encourages spending and investment. However, high or unpredictable inflation can erode the value of money, disrupt financial planning, and lead to economic uncertainty.<br>
Generally higher inflation in a country generally leads to a weaker currency relative to countries with lower inflation.<br><br>
### Problem
The objective of this analysis is to determine the extent to which inflation rates in India and the United States influence the INR/USD exchange rate over time.<br>
Identify the correlation between inflation rates and the exchange rate, considering potential lag effects.<br>
Analyze whether the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory holds by comparing the actual exchange rate with the expected exchange rate based on inflation differentials.<br>
Explore any deviations from the expected PPP-based exchange rate to uncover other economic factors that may contribute to exchange rate fluctuations.<br><br>
### Analysis 
The comparitive analysis of inflation rate of US and india and Exchange rate shows that the exchange rate is influenced by additional factors beyond inflation, such as economic growth, monetary policy, and international trade dynamics.To Check that we used Expected Exchange rate using PPP. but it shows higher exchange rate than actual exchange rate.
